# Master's Thesis Code

This repository contains the code accompanying the Master's thesis by Joe Dylan Back in Statistics:

**A Simultaneous Autoregressive Model for Composition-Valued Trajectory Data on Network Structures with Application to the Berlin Public Transport System**

The project analyses public transport delay patterns in the Berlin bus network using GTFS structure data, realtime VBB delay data, graph-based representations, compositional data transformations, and spatial autoregressive modelling.

## Main Files

NOTE THAT PYTHON VERSION 3.10.13 WAS USED FOR ALL NOTEBOOKS. For some newer Versions some packages might not fully work or install.
All graphics included in the text can be found and reproduced in the following notebooks. They are separated by topic.


- `Code/thesis_EDA.ipynb`: exploratory analysis of GTFS and realtime delay data in the compositional space
- `Code/Models.ipynb`: main modeling notebook, with applications and results from the SAR modeling
- `Code/Simulations.ipynb`: simulation studies to observe the robustness of the approach
- `Code/thesis_core.py`: core functions for loading GTFS data, graph construction, SAR modelling, and simulations
- `Code/Data_Processing/Workfiles/preprocessing_busdata.py`: preprocessing functions for realtime and compositional bus delay data

## Data

The data are not included in this GitHub repository due to file size.
The code expects the following local data structure:

```text
Data/
├── data_raw/
│   └── vbb_realtime_delays_buses_*.csv
├── GTFS_Structure_Data/
│   └── GTFS_160126/
│       ├── stops.txt
│       ├── trips.txt
│       ├── stop_times.txt
│       └── routes.txt
└── logs/
```

The data is submitted separately via WeTransfer.

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code

Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab from the project root:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Recommended order:

1. `Code/thesis_EDA.ipynb`
2. `Code/Models.ipynb`
3. `Code/Simulations.ipynb`

## Notes

The paths in `thesis_core.py` are defined relative to the project root. Therefore, the project folder can be moved to another machine as long as the `Code/` and `Data/` folders keep the same structure.
